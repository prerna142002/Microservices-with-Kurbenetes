Best practoces for building deployable SAAS apps
1. Portable
2. Continually Deployable - GCP, AWS
3. Scalable 


1. CodeBase:
  a. Always tracked in a version control systems. A copy of the revision tracking database is known as code repository, often shortened to code repo or just repo.
  b. Coorelation between app and codebase:
      i. If there are mutiple codebases, its not an app its a distributed system. Each component 
      ii. Multiple Apps sharing the same code is a voilation of 12 factor. Solution here is to to use depedency manager 

2. Dependecies
  a. Offer a packaging system for distributed support libraries such as CPAN for Perl or Rubygems for Ruby.

3. Config 
  a. Everything that is going to vary between deploys (staging, prod etc). 
  b. Dont store as constants. Voilation, strict separation of config from code.
  c. Store in environment variables

4. Backing services
  a. Any service the app consumes over the nework as part of its normal operations.
  b. E.g.: Datastores (MySQL, CouchDb), Messaging/queuing systems (RabbitMQ), SMTP (Postfix) and caching systems (Memcached).
  c. Each distict backing service is a resource.

5. Build, release and run stages
