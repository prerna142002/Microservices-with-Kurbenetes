When it comes to managing applications then native OS are good at : Installing and Starting/Stopping

Not at:
1. Running mutiple version or instances

Containers:
To solve the problem of running software across different Operating environments.
1. Independent packages - get independent self-contained packages that avoid version conflicts
2. Namespace Isolation - There alot of types of isolations like network isolations


Containers are similar to VMs but much lighter.

Dockerfile
Text documents that contain all of the necessary steps for buidlding an image from the command line.
When used with the Docker build command, automates that process by executing these command line instructions to build the resulting image.
Dockerfile are always named this way because when the the Docker build command kicks off the command that uses our Docker file to create an image, it also creates a context of all the files in
our directory and its subdirectories.
The build daemon will then search for a file called Dockerfile, although in practice its base to just start
with an empty directory as context and keep your docker file there.

The right thing to do is to push your container images to remote repository and leverage tools like Docker to fetch 
those images from a central place when we need to run them.
