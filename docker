When it comes to managing applications then native OS are good at : Installing and Starting/Stopping

Not at:
1. Running mutiple version or instances

Containers:
To solve the problem of running software across different Operating environments.
1. Independent packages - get independent self-contained packages that avoid version conflicts
2. Namespace Isolation - There alot of types of isolations like network isolations


Containers are similar to VMs but much lighter.
