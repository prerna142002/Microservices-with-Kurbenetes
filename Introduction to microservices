Previous release was something which would take alot of effort.
So, to reduce that effort we needed the break our application into smaller chuncks and this reduced our effort.
So, now build time is not going from hours to seconds time and wrap around a container and deply the container.

Speeding up the deployment cycle.
So, when working with the project involving various people then in that case we have a block because of 1 small issue also - creates a choke point.
We dont need to coordinate those peices then in that case we are going back to monolithic architecture.
